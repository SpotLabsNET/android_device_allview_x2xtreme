#New, smaller device tree for Allview X2 Soul Xtreme
Be careful, it's not tested one!

IT'S BEEN MADE FROM SCRATCH!

Partially based on my old device tree (available in "cm12.1" branch) and root-expert's android_device_blu_gionee repository.

Thanks
* CyanogenMod Team for a whole idea
* root-expert for his device tree for Blu Pure XL
* redmi-note-dev Team for their device tree for Xiaomi Redmi Note 2
