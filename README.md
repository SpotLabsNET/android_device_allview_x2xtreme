# Source Code for Allview X2 Soul Xtreme
#New, smaller device tree for Allview X2 Soul Xtreme
This tree seems to be working (I mean compiling without errors), compiled .zip won't boot

IT'S BEEN MADE FROM SCRATCH!

Partially based on my old device tree (available in "cm12.1" branch) and root-expert's android_device_blu_gionee repository.

Thanks
* CyanogenMod Team for a whole idea
* root-expert for his device tree for Blu Pure XL
