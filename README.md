# Source Code for Allview X2 Soul Xtreme
#New, smaller device tree for Allview X2 Soul Xtreme
This tree seems to be working (I mean compiling without errors), compiled .zip won't boot.

This tree allows you to compile TWRP v3.0.0-0

IT'S BEEN MADE FROM SCRATCH!

Partially based on my old device tree (available in "cm12.1" branch) and root-expert's android_device_blu_gionee repository.

Kernel source for MT6795 based devices: https://github.com/bemolxd/android_kernel_allview_x2xtreme

Thanks
* CyanogenMod Team for a whole idea
* root-expert for his device tree for Blu Pure XL
